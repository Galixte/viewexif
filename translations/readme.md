# Translations for viewexif
In the subfolders you'll find the existing translations for viewexif. I will create a subfolder for each version of the language files. Please keep in mind, that version numbering of the language files regulary only changes when there is a change in the **en** (british english) language files. If there are no language changes from a previous version, you can continue to use the former langauge pack.

If you want to contribute to the translations, please feel free to send a pull request to the relevant folder with a properly packed zip file.

You can also upload translations to the [support section on phpBB.com](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/view_exif_data/support), see [the translation topic over there](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/view_exif_data/support/topic/165751) or in the [support section of my contribution board](http://canonknipser.com/viewforum.php?f=2)
